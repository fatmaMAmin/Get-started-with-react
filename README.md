# Get-started-with-react

This project will show simple react project and how to start creating your first react app.

we will use create-react app package and visual studio code. 

follow the steps to ensure smooth build :)

Install node.js LTS from https://nodejs.org/en/

create folder with your project name EX: testproject

Right click on it and open with code.. u will have no files till now :) 

in the reminal write

npm install create-react-app -urapplicationname
then nom start it will run ur app on 3000 port and will open it for you


. In the source code we already created app using json server querying (user, user details with album , photos ...etc ) so you can open this folder direct but u will still need to ensure installing create-react-app package and react-router 

let me know if you have any questions
